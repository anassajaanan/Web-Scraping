Greeting from New York, which is getting into the holiday season with tree lights, mask-free parties — and a sense of relief that the bizarre year that was 2022 is drawing to an end. As it does, there are two quite contradictory trends shaping the world of sustainability.
On the one hand, environmental, social and governance-based investing is under mounting fire from rightwing groups in America. Read our tale below about new attacks on Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, over this — including calls for his resignation.
On the other hand, more and more money is flooding into renewable energy and other ESG sectors, such as hydrogen. A few weeks ago, to cite one example, the Paris-based HY-24 fund raised €2bn from entities such as TotalEnergies, Axa and Baker Hughes — and more funds are mooted. See our story below about efforts to get proper measurement systems in place for hydrogen investments. And take note of another important development that emerged as we went to press: there has been a breakthrough in fusion technology that could potentially offer another clean energy source. Cue more investor excitement.
So which of these factors — namely the political backlash or the flood of investment bucks into green projects — will be more dominant in 2023? And will this reshape ESG, or even make the term redundant? We would love to hear your thoughts as the year draws to an end; please email the moralmoney@ft.com team. (Gillian Tett)
Barely a day goes by without fresh debate about the future of electric vehicles in general — and Tesla in particular (not least because its share price has halved in recent months, knocking owner Elon Musk out of the slot of the world’s richest man). But amid all the EV excitement — and anxiety about the alarmingly limited supply of battery metals — many investors and industrial groups are now looking more closely at hydrogen too.
Companies in Japan and Korea have already developed hydrogen-powered cars. But the real focus is on marine transport and heavy industry. S&P Global predicts that annual global hydrogen demand will jump to 97mn tonnes in 2030 and 249mn tonnes in 2050 — from 70.4mn tonnes in 2020 — and nearly 90 per cent of the growth between now and 2050 is expected to come from new sectors like heavy-duty transportation, steel production, and long-term energy storage.
This is encouraging. But there is a catch: hydrogen production is energy intensive, and the supply of energy varies in its level of carbon intensity. So a race is now on to develop systems which will enable companies and financial groups to track this footprint.
Take an industry coalition called the Open Hydrogen Initiative. This, as we earlier reported, was established by the ratings and analysis group S&P Global in early 2022, together with GTI Energy (a consultancy) and the National Energy Technology Laboratory. The coalition has been carrying out pilot tests and this week it will announce that it has signed up more than a dozen companies, including National Grid, Shell, ExxonMobil, Dominion Energy, Duke Energy, DTE, and Southwest Gas Corporation. The body plans to start publishing data next year, and is using an open-source platform in a bid to crowd-test its systems and (it hopes) establish widely accepted industry standards.
It remains to be seen if these standards will be widely adopted, and other rival systems are emerging too from entities such as Deutsche Börse. But the battle to create transparent ways to track hydrogen’s footprint has the potential to become a fascinating case study in how to create credibility for an emerging technology (or not). And the move will be watched by governments, given that politicians such as Britain’s Boris Johnson have been embracing the fuel, business leaders such as Australia’s Andrew Forrest are jumping in — and the EU is building a so-called “hydrogen bank,” in a bid to wean the continent off fossil fuels.
The EU’s €3bn investment in low carbon hydrogen projects was “the latest in a raft of measures aimed at supporting the scaling of low carbon hydrogen markets”, said Alan Hayes, head of energy transition pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.
Of course, if the data that emanates from the OHI next year shows that the fuel is not as green as proclaimed, when the entire production chain is analysed, that could puncture the hype around hydrogen. But right now the excitement seems set to bubble on — particularly given that the US’s Inflation Reduction Act is due to kick in on January 1, with its raft of subsidies for green tech.

The attacks on BlackRock’s approach to sustainable investing are getting personal. On Friday, North Carolina treasurer Dale Folwell called for founder Larry Fink to resign or be removed as chief executive of the $8tn asset manager.

“BlackRock needs to be liberated,” Folwell told Moral Money. “Mr Fink’s political agenda has gotten in the way of his fiduciary duty.”

The move is the latest in a series of blasts at the world’s largest asset manager from Republican politicians who argue that BlackRock’s use of ESG factors in investing is hostile to fossil fuel companies and hurts their constituents. Nearly half a dozen red states have promised to pull more than $3bn out of BlackRock-managed accounts.

But Folwell, who was first elected treasurer in 2016, is taking a different tack. The North Carolina Retirement Systems, the ninth largest public pension fund in the US, will use its $46mn in BlackRock shares, a roughly 0.04 per cent stake, to push for Fink’s removal.

Fink’s leadership is already under attack from the opposite direction. Bluebell Capital Partners, a small UK activist investor with a history of mobilising coalitions, revealed earlier this week that it had taken a 0.01 per cent stake and asked Fink to resign because BlackRock was insufficiently supportive of ESG.

Folwell said that he had no plans to move the $14bn that the state had invested in BlackRock funds: “There is nowhere I could go to get it done cheaper.”

But he has taken advantage of BlackRock’s new programme that allows institutional investors to vote their own shares rather than allowing the fund house to use its own judgment in proxy votes on controversial issues including ESG. “We have operationalised what needs to be done in the interest of our members,” Folwell said.

BlackRock, which had net US inflows of $84bn in the third quarter, said in a statement, “Over the past year, BlackRock has been subject to campaigns suggesting we are either ‘too progressive’ or ‘too conservative’ in how we manage our clients’ money. We are neither. We are a fiduciary. We put our clients’ interests first.” (Brooke Masters)
If a company pollutes a town, does it need to clean up the mess after it leaves? That is the question which will be raised early next year when a landmark case against Anglo American, one of the world’s largest mining companies, will be heard in South Africa’s High Court.
The case revolves around a class-action suit pitching the Zambian town of Kabwe against Anglo American for alleged lead poisoning. Stand by for a big legal battle, and “test of international commitments to human rights abuses and access to justice for some of the poorest people living in an ongoing public health emergency”, writes Peter Hain in the FT. Hain is a former Labour MP who was an anti-apartheid campaigner in South Africa.

Every publication of financial statistics ought to have the same picture on the cover — Goya’s “The Sleep Of Reason Produces Monsters”. It would help to deter the tidy-minded truth seekers who are reliably driven mad by the crazy world of financial accounting.
People, for example, like Harvey Jones of the Daily Express, who reacted to the recent BIS Quarterly Review article on off-balance sheet FX forwards by concluding that “the world faces financial meltdown, with losses potentially exceeding the total number of US dollars in circulation”. That’s not true, by the way.
It’s an understandable shock reaction, though. For a normal person or company, finding out that you’ve got more debt than you thought you had is a horrible thing — quite apart from anything else, it raises the immediate question of how you’re going to pay it. If the global financial system really was running on a macro-scale version of Sam Bankman-Fried’s sloppy spreadsheets, that would be a reason to panic.
But the BIS doesn’t claim this; there’s no suggestion that anyone has been failing to record actual transactions. Their research is composed of an argument that some financial instruments should be classified as debt, and some clever work interpreting the gaps between different data sets to estimate how much difference it would make to global balance sheets if they were.
That means that the joke once attributed to Abraham Lincoln is relevant. “If you call a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have? Four, because calling a tail a leg doesn’t mean it is one”. The state of the world is what it is; if we were to decide to increase our estimate of the amount of debt in it by $80tn, then we would need to make an exactly offsetting adjustment in the extent to which every trillion dollars of global debt worried us.
Accounting is, unfortunately, a business of compromise. There are two things you want to get from an accounting system:
1) Accurate reflection of the underlying economics.
2) Consistency across different economic entities.
Brief consideration of these two principles immediately leads to the conclusion that in any even moderately complicated system, you can’t get all that you want. So any accounting system is a trade-off — it’s a choice that you make, reflecting how much consistency you need and how much inaccuracy you’re prepared to tolerate. Which in turn is going to be driven by the purpose that you’re going to use the numbers for.
The BIS’ estimate that there is about $80tn worth of off-balance sheet “debt” is fundamentally a consequence of the fact that the BIS doesn’t choose the accounting standards, and consequently the accounting standards are designed for purposes other than theirs.
As Richard Comotto put it (back in 2017, when this debate first went round, and when the missing “debt” was only $17tn), the core argument of the BIS is that if you have domestic cash and want to buy a foreign currency asset but hedge the currency risk, you have two ways of doing that:
1) Exchange your domestic cash for forex in the spot market, buy the asset and sell an equivalent amount of forex for domestic cash in the forward market.
2) Keep your domestic cash, and use the foreign repo market to fund the purchase of the asset.
(there is another way, using a currency swap, but for the purposes of this argument, it’s the same as the first. In fact, there are dozens and dozens of ways of achieving the same financial goal and some of them don’t create the kinds of exposures we’re talking about here, but these are the ones big enough to worry the BIS).
Option 2 feels like it’s obviously debt. You’ve got the asset, you’ve got an obligation to repay your repo counterparty, and you’ve still got your original cash. You’ve increased your leverage.
Option 1 doesn’t feel so much like debt. You’ve bought your asset, and you’ve entered into a contract which affects the returns on that asset. On the day you do the transaction, the value of that contract is zero — it might turn into an obligation or benefit in the future, but it’s not obvious that you should record something on your balance sheet today.
And that is, more or less, how the relevant financial accounting standards tell you to record things. But the BIS sees it differently. Back in 2017, they printed some stylised balance sheets to explain what they mean.
What this table is meant to illustrate is that the FX forward case is not quite as clear cut as it seems. Most derivatives are settled on a net basis: on the settlement date, the “winner” of the trade receives a payment from the “loser” reflecting the P&L. That’s the basis on which they’re recorded in the balance sheet.
Forwards, on the other hand, are settled gross, with an exchange of principal amounts. On the last day of the contract you send over the relevant amount of FX that you had sold forward, and receive the corresponding amount of domestic currency. That’s the significance of the second line in the “Gross basis” table.
The BIS argument is that this obligation for gross settlement looks a bit debt-ish. If something stops you from delivering the FX, then you’re in default.
The introductory section here should hopefully have made clear that the answer is going to be “it depends”.
If you’re putting together a set of financial accounts that are meant to reflect the risks and rewards of ownership, then an FX forward looks very like a derivative. Those risks and rewards are mainly driven by the P&L on the forex trade, which is something that is going to happen in the future rather than an obligation which exists on the balance sheet date.
Because it’s a forward rather than a derivative, there is an obligation, but it’s not much of a risk; if the counterparty doesn’t deliver their domestic currency, then you don’t deliver your forex, and your exposure to loss is determined by how much it costs you to get your books squared up again.
The gross settlement obligation only becomes a significant factor in an odd and bizarre situation, when for some reason one of the parties has delivered their side of the bargain, but then the other party doesn’t.
That can happen from time to time, because the bankers’ right to set off payments owed against payments owing isn’t always legally perfect, and because the two sides of the forward settlement aren’t always executed simultaneously. In fact, they might be executed several hours apart, particularly when the counterparties are in different time zones.
Which is the point at issue. The kinds of situations in which the settlement risk might manifest itself are exactly the sorts of things that it’s the job of the BIS to care about. The failure of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974, while owing a lot of money in this manner, was one of the big reasons why the BIS collects these sorts of statistics today.
And when you take into consideration that we’re talking about unusual risks, it actually seems quite legitimate for the BIS to be worrying — the accounting issue is one for debates over coffee and beer, but the fact that the estimate has more than quadrupled in five years does feel like someone ought to be keeping an eye on it.
It’s not just a matter of settlement risk at the level of individual firms. The BIS team found that there are big national imbalances, which could mean that if one national market lost access to dollar funding, this could result in very large waves of default.
This isn’t just a theoretical possibility, either. The international central bank swap lines, dating back to the global financial crisis of 2008, are there precisely to manage this sort of risk; that of basically solvent counterparties being forced into default because they aren’t able to make payments and their domestic central bank can’t supply the kind of liquidity they need.
The availability of those swap lines (particularly those by which the Fed supports the international market in US dollars) means that the accountants are broadly right to treat FX forwards in the way they do.
Accounts are meant to give a true and fair view of the risks and rewards, and a figure which is made by adding up normal borrowings, repo, and the full gross settlement exposure of derivatives — that’s just not a useful number. Calling it “debt” doesn’t make it debt any more than calling a tail a leg makes it one.
But if we don’t get hung up on the d-word, then the BIS analysis is valuable too.
What it really describes is the extent to which the global role of the US dollar is dependent on the Fed being willing to act as the lender of last resort to the international market as well as the domestic one.
And the fact that this role — and the consequent international liability — has not only grown so fast, but done so in a way that’s heavily underestimated by the statistics, seems like it’s something worth knowing.

Inverse Japanese government bond or inverse US Treasury ETFs will be launched “sooner or later” in Japan, because local institutions are on the lookout for more instruments to minimise risk exposure, a Tokyo stock exchange official said.
“That’s the one interesting agenda that asset managers are looking at,” said Kei Okazaki, head of ETF secondary trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, who regularly communicates with about 700 institutional investors every year.
“There’s investor demand for [US] Treasury inverse and JGB [Japan government bond] inverse ETFs, and technically they’re not too difficult to formulate,” he added.
Banks, which have large positions in Japanese government bonds and US Treasury bonds, could use inverse products to hedge against potential declines in their portfolios.
This article was previously published by Ignites Asia, a title owned by the FT Group.
Some Japanese traders have also shorted government bonds, hoping the Bank of Japan will shift away from its longstanding policy of capping bond yields.
BlackRock manages the only Japanese government bond ETF in the market, the iShares Core Japan Government Bond ETF, which has garnered $119.4mn in assets, according to Morningstar data.
The ETF posted a loss of 5.22 per cent in the year to October, in line with its benchmark FTSE Japanese Government Bond Index’s minus 5.15 per cent return over the same period, according to BlackRock data.
Leveraged and inverse ETFs have been making a broader comeback in Japan, after a gap of more than six years between fund launches from September 2015 until February this year, when Daiwa Asset Management launched the iFreeETF Nasdaq 100 Inverse ETF.
A﻿sset managers have begun to take notice of the high trading volumes, with the median trading volume of such funds coming in at 1.1mn units in October — almost twice that of all ETFs, exchange data show.
Sho Shibamoto, senior vice-president of ETF business development at Nikko Asset Management, said that although asset managers would prefer investors buy and hold funds, the high trading volume of leveraged and inverse ETFs is indicative of investor demand.
The 30 leveraged and inverse ETFs currently listed in Japan have total assets of US$5.4bn, making up about 2 per cent of the entire $253bn Japanese ETF market, according to Morningstar data.
Daiwa AM is the only asset manager that has rolled out such funds so far this year with three new funds, which are the first ones to track the Nasdaq 100 index in the category.
These include the iFreeETF Nasdaq 100 Inverse ETF introduced earlier in the year, and the iFreeETF Nasdaq 100 Leveraged 2x and iFreeETF Nasdaq 100 Double Inverse -2x products launched last month.
“Daiwa would like to be a company well known for providing Nasdaq-linked ETFs,” said Masafumi Fujiwara, managing director of Daiwa AM’s ETF business.

The Bank for International Settlements is worried about “fragility” in the market for mortgage-backed securities. And volatility has soared in US Treasury markets this autumn due to poor liquidity.
With the world poised to plunge into recession, stresses are to be expected. But there is growing evidence that the post-crisis reforms, while aimed at shoring up financial stability may have, in important areas, simply traded counterparty risk for liquidity risk.
Back in the 2008 crisis, much of the contagion stemmed from trades between failing institutions and stronger ones. When insurer AIG sold more credit default swaps than it could make good on, its failure threatened to topple a whole slew of banks that were on the other side of those trades. Similarly, the collapse of Lehman Brothers inflicted destabilising losses on money market funds that held its debt.
Since then regulators have concentrated on making sure individual banks are stronger and less vulnerable to troubles brewing in less regulated parts of the financial sector, known collectively as shadow banks. More transactions now run through central clearing houses or require more collateral. The idea is that if one side gets into trouble, the other side is not left holding the bag.
To a large extent they succeeded. Global banks are much better capitalised than they once were. Many transactions, including those involving complex derivatives, have shifted from what was essentially unsecured lending to margin-based arrangements backed by cash or safe, easy-to-sell assets.
But that has not always translated into the broad financial stability policymakers had hoped for. Mass selling in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic forced the US Federal Reserve to backstop both money market funds and the market for commercial paper.
More recently, the London Metal Exchange in March shut trading and cancelled billions of dollars in deals because surging nickel prices had inflicted a $2.6bn loss on the clearing house it had set up to try to stop contagion. Then in September, the Bank of England was forced to intervene when forced selling to meet margin calls destabilised the UK gilt market.
“We are seeing liquidity strains in places that my generation of central bankers wouldn’t have expected, and hoped to prevent by constraining shadow banking,” says Paul Tucker, the former BoE deputy governor who helped lead the UK response to the 2008 financial crisis.
The displacement of counterparty risk into liquidity risk comes from several sources. In Treasury markets, Wall Street banks used to play a critical warehousing role, particularly in the short-term lending “repo” market. But tougher capital rules have led them to prioritise other, higher-margin business lines, and other market participants have shown no signs of stepping into their shoes. Instead, when volatility rises, hedge funds and high-frequency traders step away from their keyboards.
“Dealer banks are now driven by profit per unit of balance sheet and repo is not at the top of the list,” says the IMF’s Manmohan Singh. “They are judged on share price not on whether they help with the US treasury markets.”
The emphasis on collateral has also contributed to instability in ways that policymakers did not anticipate, most notably by amplifying selling pressure. The UK gilt market meltdown is a prime example: UK pension funds had bought derivatives as part of a strategy known as liability-driven investing. When gilt prices fell sharply, they received margin calls requiring them to post more collateral, so they sold gilts, further driving down the price, leading to more margin calls.
A third kind of illiquidity has emerged in recent years as investors moved beyond bank accounts, stocks and bonds in search of higher returns. In times of market turmoil, funds focused on real estate, private credit and the like have been hit by more redemption requests than they can easily handle. Blackstone recently limited withdrawals from its $69bn Breit private real estate fund after breaching monthly and quarterly limits on redemptions.
Bankers argue that one way to help would be to treat government bond holdings more leniently in capital calculations but that could encourage lenders to game the rules and reawaken counterparty risk. Some regulators want to tighten the scrutiny and collateral rules for nonbanks, but that could exacerbate forced selling during market downturns.
With economic stress growing, policymakers are running out of time to find the right trade-off between sources of risk.

We’ve had 1) good market liquidity and function in the zero-rates era, 2) good liquidity and dysfunction during the flash rally, and 3) illiquidity and dysfunction around the Covid-19 shutdowns and reopenings.
It now looks like 2022 has brought a new combination: Illiquidity paired with decent market function.
JPMorgan’s rates strategists point out in a note this week that market depth has declined significantly in the past year:
. . . market depth has declined about 60% over the last year and is sitting at levels only seen in late-2008/early-2009 at the tail end of the GFC and in spring 2020, coming out of the global COVID-19 lockdown. Increased Treasury curve dispersion also alludes to weakened liquidity conditions.
That echoes a post from the New York Fed’s Liberty Street Economics blog, which found a similar decline in market depth, and a “modest” widening in bid-ask spreads:
And a rise in the price impact of trades:
So it’s been more expensive to trade, and tougher to move paper in size.
Notably, however, there haven’t been severe dislocations like those seen around the unusually rough 7-year auction in 2021, or the early days of Covid in 2020.
Both JPMorgan and the New York Fed point out that the main driver of the illiquidity is good old-fashioned price volatility. That’s the type that comes from fundamental economic factors and Fed policy, not global investors panicking over a pandemic and fleeing to dollar markets. In other words: Duration risk has returned to Treasuries.
Back to JPMorgan:
When we take a step back, it’s clear monetary policy uncertainty and the associated increase in volatility propelled the declines we’ve seen in various measures of liquidity this year, but there has also been an overlay of market structure changes which leave these measures at lower levels than we would otherwise expect. However, unlike prior episodes of similarly low liquidity, we do not think we are in the midst of a crisis, because the Treasury market continues to function in relatively normal fashion. As we can tell, there is no discernible liquidity preference in on-the-runs versus off-the-runs . . . On-the-runs trade with a premium relative to their near off-the-run cousins, but these levels are not out of line with average levels observed over the past 15 years, and do not show any signs of distress, in contrast to early-2020 and late-2008.
And some measures of market liquidity don’t look nearly as dire:
Dealers are warehousing more Treasuries, too! “Inventories have risen somewhat in 2022,” the bank writes.
Over the longer term, dealers’ holdings haven’t grown nearly as much as the market -- that’s where the hedge funds have stepped in. But we at Alphaville are old enough to remember when regulations and high levels of Treasury issuance were supposedly going to cause primary dealers to stop making markets altogether.

Given its size — it famously owns an average 1.5 per cent of every listed company in the world — it’s worth a closer look.
Some of the headline changes were trailed by chief executive Nicolai Tangen at an FT conference on Wednesday, a day before the formal strategy plan was released:
The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund will become a more vocal shareholder and plans to vote against companies that fail to set a net zero emissions target, overpay their top leaders, or do not have sufficiently diverse boards.
Some background: Norges Bank Investment Management is formally housed inside the central bank, its money comes from Norway’s oil and gas revenues, its investment mandate is formulated by the finance ministry and approved by parliament.
Also some disclosure: the author of this post is Norwegian [but you never mention it — Ed], lives in Oslo, and has given speeches to the fund literally talking his book (one free, and one where the fee was directly donated to UNICEF by NBIM).
The governance stuff is naturally what will generate the most heat. ESG is suffering a bit of a backlash at the moment (FTAV is a bit sceptical as well), but given Norwegian politics the sovereign wealth fund cannot help but be seen to be at the vanguard of the issue. NBIM was excluding companies on ethical grounds long before ESG was even a glimmer in the eyes of asset-management marketing directors.
But most interesting (to us) titbit hinted at by Tangen on Wednesday was that NBIM could take better advantage of its long-term investment perspective and limited liquidity needs to “be more contrarian”. (These days it’s getting harder to find anyone who won’t describe themselves as a contrarian.)
But how? After all, its mandate doesn’t leave much room for flexibility.
About 70 per cent of NBIM’s money is in equities, and roughly 30 per cent in fixed income. It is gradually building up a real estate portfolio that will in time account for 3–7 per cent of the fund’s assets (in 2020 NBIM was also allowed to invest up to 2 per cent in renewable infrastructure projects). The vast majority of the sovereign wealth fund’s money is pretty much passive.
But Tangen is a former hedge fund manager, and it makes sense that he wants to be more than just the world’s biggest beta monkey. And NBIM apparently now thinks that it can be smarter and more tactical within the straitjacket of its investment mandate.
Here’s the top level bit of the strategy report fleshing out a little what Tangen was hinting at:
Central to the management mandate is the benchmark index consisting of 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income. We manage the fund close to this index. However, we believe some investment opportunities diversify the fund beyond the reference index, particularly unlisted assets. All our investment processes have active elements. This improves our ability to achieve the highest possible return and to be a responsible owner.
We take advantage of the fund’s long horizon and limited short-term liquidity needs when we invest. We can withstand large fluctuations in the fund’s value and make investments whose underlying value may take a long time to realise. Our long horizon enables us to act differently from other investors in difficult and illiquid markets. We believe that the most profitable investment opportunities arise in volatile markets…
...In this strategy period we will strengthen our long-term mindset, be patient, and vary active risk as market conditions change. This allows us to take advantage of the best opportunities when they arise. Variations in asset prices can be related to behavioural factors or leverage causing procyclicality. Long-term investors are well-positioned to take advantage of such variations. We will seek to buy when others want to sell and sell when others want to buy.
Some of this kinda makes sense. The Norwegian government is supposed to only spend roughly the 3 per cent long-term real return of the fund annually (originally 4 per cent), so NBIM can take a very different perspective from even other supposedly long-term investors like pension plans.
Efforts to minimise the costs and maximising the advantages of scale are therefore natural. For example, in equities NBIM says it wants to invest more in automation, boost collaboration between traders and portfolio managers to improve execution, and be more opportunistic and aggressive in share lending and situations like IPOs and rights issues.
Our size makes us an attractive partner in capital market events. Investors who are passive in such events may risk less allocation than desired. To reduce the likelihood of this, we work actively with facilitators and companies considering such transactions. A large, stable capital base and the best credit standing also make us an attractive partner for securities lending. The fund’s characteristics enable us to achieve higher earnings on securities lending than the average investor.
Fine fine fine. This is an obvious area where NBIM can probably sweat a few more basis points of performance out of its portfolio. And even a few basis points adds up in absolute nominal dollar terms when you manage a whopping $1.3tn.
But we get a bit more nervous when we see the more concrete ways that Tangen wants the sovereign wealth fund to be more “contrarian”:
“We will take sector risk when risk-reward is particularly attractive and use our specialist knowledge to identify trends that make us expect higher long-term returns in some sectors than others.”
“We will expand our forensic accounting and behavioural analysis to reduce exposure to companies we expect to underperform.”
“We will identify quality companies and take slightly larger stakes when we have reason to believe they will outperform.”
“We will use external managers in segments and markets where we believe they will enhance returns. In some markets, we also believe external managers will reduce the risk of our investments by avoiding certain companies with problematic business models and weak corporate governance.”
“We will pursue the opportunity to invest in companies before they list (pre-IPO). This would give us access to companies earlier in the company life cycle and potentially enhance returns.”
In similar vein, in fixed income NBIM plans to “invest in selected segments outside the benchmark to diversify the portfolio and harvest risk premia”, while the property division plans to us its ability to invest in both listed and private assets to “exploit periods of disruptions in real estate markets”. (CC: BREIT).
To encourage this shift NBIM plans to “promote psychological safety so that our portfolio managers dare to be contrarian and avoid herd behaviour”, and more actively tweak broader and sectoral allocation positions and risk-taking “as market conditions change”. Mkay.
We’re not going to go so far as to say that this is a former hedge fund manager hedge fundifying NBIM, even though it is tempting.
The fund is just too big and the mandate too restrictive. These are just tweaks around the edges. And frankly a lot of them make intuitive sense. Size and a practically unlimited investment horizon are huge advantages if harnessed well.
For example, one of the issues with exploiting many investment factors/risk premia is (if one believes in their existence in the first place) is that it is VERY hard to hang on when there are periodically long and/or deep stretches of underperformance.
This isn’t just a foible of ordinary yokel investors. In practice, pension plans often also struggle to keep faith. Even true believers can eventually throw in the towel — often just before things turn around. And as Tangen told my colleague Richard Milne, NBIM has already made some canny moves:
Last year, we overweighted integrated energy companies. When a lot of investors jumped up and down and told everybody how proud they were they had no energy exposure, that’s when we scooped a lot of these positions. They don’t come about all the time but sometimes various sectors or companies are oversold or overbought.
We had the same in the bond portfolio, where a big part were trading with negative rates. The risk-return was really skewed: you knew there were limits for how negative the rates could go but there was no limit for how much it could go up. You sometimes have these really skewed situations. Historically we haven’t been good enough at taking advantage of them.
However, the harsh reality is that attempts to time markets — whether it is in cute tactical asset allocation shifts or sectoral tilts — is a fraught business. Just because it makes intuitive sense it doesn’t mean it makes sense in theory or in practice.
The academic evidence suggests that market timing is hard. Even most practitioners agree that it should be avoided. If you avoid the worst of a sell-off you can still lose out overall by missing the rebound, for example. As Elroy Dimson, a finance professor at the London Business School who led a previous strategic review for NBIM a decade ago, has bluntly put it:
…oftentimes, when people make a prediction, they get it wrong. And the cost, for example, of trying to avoid the worst times or capture the best is that you might get it completely wrong. That simply increases the risk, over the long haul, of your investment portfolio.
Maybe NBIM’s in-house “specialist knowledge” will allow it to pick sectors and “quality” companies better than the broader market? Perhaps its four-person team of forensic accountants will be able to spot frauds quicker than any auditor, short seller, financial watchdog or journalist? Conceivably it could pick pre-IPO investments better than all the other big fund complexes that flooded this zone in recent years (and are now ruing it)?
It seems a stretch though. Oftentimes, contrarian investing seems to be a fancy way of saying: “Will blame long periods of underperformance on central banks and claim personal credit every time they enjoy six good months of returns”.
Tangen seems aware that with these changes he is making a rod for his own back though. As he told Richard:
Living in a world where you invest in a contrarian way, that’s a life without any friends. It’s kind of where I live. I’ve lived there my whole life.

Welcome back. This has been a rough week for those with high hopes for voluntary corporate action on climate change. Vanguard, the world’s second-biggest asset management company, has pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, complaining of “confusion about the views of individual investment firms”.
As we’ve been writing, this follows an intense backlash from US Republican politicians against the financial sector net zero agenda. After several big financial companies threatened to quit Gfanz, the umbrella grouping for NZAM and other sectoral alliances, it loosened its standards to keep them in the tent. It seems that may not have been enough. Vanguard is by far the biggest name to quit Gfanz since its high-profile launch last year — and others may now feel emboldened to follow.
Another blow to the green-hearted has come here in London, where Rishi Sunak’s government has authorised the UK’s first new coal mine in three decades. You could read this as a ham-fisted move from a reactionary administration — or as a broader sign of governments’ wavering green commitments amid energy market turmoil.
Where do we go from here? That was the subject of my conversation with the influential author and academic Mariana Mazzucato. Instead of pinning our hopes on voluntary corporate action, she says, we should look to governments to galvanise change — not through tinkering with energy policy for short-term fixes, but by making better use of their investing firepower.
Also today: asset managers have been complaining that corporate audits don’t take climate risks seriously enough. So what are they doing about it? Kenza has the latest. (Simon Mundy)
In the intensifying intellectual debate over the future of capitalism in recent years, one of the most influential — and disruptive — voices has been that of Mariana Mazzucato, an Italian-born academic at University College London who has taken a string of senior advisory roles to major global institutions and governments.
At the core of Mazzucato’s argument — as set out in an acclaimed series of tightly argued books — is a rebellion against the idea that the private sector should set the course of the global economy. Instead, she argues, the state needs to take a far more proactive approach, using its huge resources to tackle society’s most urgent problems head-on, and “crowding in” private investment in the process.
And nowhere is this approach more urgently needed, she told me in a recent conversation, than in the response to the climate crisis. Too often, Mazzucato argued, we have been assuming that voluntary initiatives by the private sector can pave the way for effective government action. “I think it’s the opposite,” she told me. “If you look at the internet, nanotech, biotech — government money tends to lead.”
Not only should governments craft laws and regulations conducive to private sector investment in the energy transition, she argues — states need to make much fuller use of their enormous financial firepower. When they have used that clout, she complains, they’ve often had an excessively tight focus on specific sectors — witness, for example, the UK’s controversial efforts to bolster the vehicle battery sector.
Instead of targeting specific industries, she reckons, governments need to organise their investment plans around clearly defined “missions”.
“The point of the entrepreneurial state is not to flood the system with money — it’s about tackling problems,” she told me.
I suggested that the development of Covid-19 vaccines could be seen as an example of successful intervention by states — notably the US government — that put huge sums of money behind that endeavour. Not quite, Mazzucato replied.
“The mission is not the vaccine,” she said. “The mission is to vaccinate the world, if you have a global pandemic. And they failed miserably because of intellectual property rights, and all sorts of really dysfunctional behaviour.”
I asked Mazzucato if she thought any government was getting this right. The European Commission — one of her advisory clients — had made a start, she said, by allocating a chunk of its €95.5bn Horizon research funding programme to mission-driven investments. Mazzucato also approves of the bloc’s REPowerEU programme, launched this year with a mission of reducing its dependence on Russian fossil fuel imports and boosting energy security more broadly. That’s led to initiatives like a new scheme by Germany’s KfW development bank, supporting the steel sector’s transition through subsidised loans with green conditions attached.
But it’s not just in heavy industry that the state can galvanise change, she pointed out. In any country, the food procurement systems for state-run schools dwarf most commercial restaurant chains, giving them enormous purchasing power that they could use to push food systems in a more sustainable direction. But few governments — with the exception of Sweden — have yet taken up that opportunity, she said.
“We have states that, at worst, aren’t doing anything, and at best are fixing market failures,” she said. “But bandaging things up, by definition, means you’re doing too little, too late. The state should be co-creating markets, not just fixing markets.” (Simon Mundy)
A fiery report published earlier this week by Republicans on the US Senate’s banking committee alleged that asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which hold shares in index funds on behalf of clients, use their “enormous” voting power to push “liberal social goals” on ethical issues in ways that are “unmoored from financial performance”.
The senators accused the Big Three of insufficient transparency, for example, on votes meant to influence companies’ climate strategy and push them to decarbonise. It was the latest salvo in a political backlash against money managers’ public support for the energy transition.
But analysis by campaign group Greenpeace of routine audit-related votes suggests these and other asset managers’ positions on environmental issues are not as strident as the political attacks that unfolded this week might suggest.
It analysed the voting stance of 50 leading investors, including the US Big Three, and European investors like Amundi and HSBC Asset Management.
Others among those 50 investors had in April written to 17 European companies — from miner Rio Tinto to oil giant BP — who they said were failing to fully disclose critical climate risks in their company accounts. The investors warned in their letters that they would use shareholder votes to push the companies to consider climate matters that could affect investors in financial statements and audits, Reuters reported at the time.
Yet when the companies’ annual meetings rolled around this year, there was no sign of any major investor rebellion on the most important shareholder votes in this area: the appointment of auditors and audit committee chairs, and the approval of financial statements. At every one of the 17 companies, as well as at US energy giants Chevron and ExxonMobil, management won more than 90 per cent support on each of those three key votes.
“There’s no way as an investor you can make an informed judgment about how a company is dealing with risk unless this is clearly documented in its annual accounts,” Charlie Kronick, senior programme adviser at Greenpeace, told me. “If US officials in Republican states could see an accurate representation of the risk from climate change in accounts, it would be difficult for them to claim that activist voting is ideological when it is clearly based on real risks to the climate, to the economy and to shareholder value.”
BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have all emphasised their primary agenda is to maximise returns for shareholders. Countering the Republican senators’ point on voting transparency, Vanguard, which left a club of asset managers committed to net zero earlier this week, has said it will trial a scheme that allows retail investors to vote directly on proxy ballots.
Getting audit related votes right is central to ensuring economic prosperity in the face of climate risks, Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at the asset manager Sarasin & Partners, told me. “It is absolutely within the remit of stewards of capital to ensure company accounts are not misrepresenting the facts.” (Kenza Bryan)
FT columnist Jemima Kelly is struck by the key emotion expressed by Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the fallen crypto company FTX: embarrassment. “I’m not sure,” she writes, “whether feeling embarrassed quite cuts the moral mustard when we are talking about as much as $8bn having gone missing, as many as 1mn creditors having lost their money, and a collapsed $32bn crypto empire being investigated by criminal prosecutors.”

Good morning. The US Federal Trade Commission wants to block Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, citing (among other concerns) fears that Activision’s Call of Duty will become exclusive to Microsoft’s Xbox. But the real problem with Call of Duty is that it sucks. Minimising its player base, in our opinion, is a social good. Regrettably, the FTC has accomplished just the opposite.

Should regulators let crypto burn? Our view, crudely stated, is yes. These poorly understood tokens should not be legitimated by financial regulators. Unhedged readers tend to agree. Alas our line hasn’t been winning the day in Washington. From The Wall Street Journal yesterday:
Pressure is mounting on the Securities and Exchange Commission to step up enforcement of key hubs of the crypto industry after the collapse of FTX last month .
The SEC has investigations under way focusing on exchanges including Coinbase Global Inc. and the US businesses of Binance and FTX, according to people familiar with the matter and regulatory disclosures, and it has fined or sued dozens of token developers over the past six years.
The SEC has said many cryptocurrencies qualify as securities that should have been sold under rules for stocks and bonds. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said exchanges are breaking the law by selling those unregistered securities and not following rules that the Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange observe.
We think the SEC should stay away, but we were struck by a thoughtful Twitter thread by Todd Phillips, a policy consultant and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation lawyer, arguing the other way. We talked to him yesterday, and his case boils down to two points.
First, Phillips (who says he’s a “huge crypto sceptic”) is worried the “let crypto burn” argument is too callous to consumers:
The let crypto burn narrative I have heard is just don’t do anything, let it flame out. And I think that’s really the wrong way to think about it, because people are going to get hurt during that flame-out. Either we regulate it, so that we stop people from getting hurt now, or we shut it down entirely right now.
And second, existing finance law is largely sufficient for providing that consumer protection (with a few exceptions, such as the spot market for bitcoin). As Phillips wrote on Twitter:
There are a lot of bad products out there, but just because I don’t think they’re useful doesn’t mean that the people that do should go unprotected. The [US Federal Trade Commission], SEC, and other federal agencies exist to regulate bad products. This is what governments do.
We understand why this argument would fall on sympathetic ears at the SEC and US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, etc). Yet the fact crypto can be regulated under existing law doesn’t suggest it should be. The cost of doing so is conferring legitimacy on a poorly understood asset that generates little economic value and has inflicted losses on millions of investors.
But we do agree that consumer protection matters too. As Unhedged thought this over, we differed on just how to do this. Ethan thinks a customer protection regime similar to how the UK regulates contracts for differences could work: big honking warnings saying you will lose money buying this junk, mandatory stop-losses for customers, a ban on monetary inducements and so forth. Rob (who is Ethan’s boss, just to be clear) thinks that with the narrow exception of stablecoins, financial regulators should stay away. Crypto tokens are not securities any more than baseball cards or sports bets are. Prosecute fraud, maybe regulate crypto exchanges like casinos, and keep the SEC et al out of it.
This is a disagreement about how to cordon off crypto so that when crypto burns, it is controlled. But make no mistake: it should burn.
A few months ago, we argued that “long bonds are looking interesting.” We presented two scenarios under which 10-year Treasuries could work:
If the Fed sees inflation starting to cool, and remembers that policy works with (all together now!) “long and variable lags”, it might pivot towards smaller hikes, with an eye to ending rate increases altogether .
[Alternatively] the Fed overtightens badly and drives the US right into a proper recession. If that suddenly looks like the most likely outcome, 3.5 per cent on a 10-year Treasury is going to look pretty good, because the Fed will be in loosening mode soon enough.
We wrote too soon. That was September 21, when the 10-year yield stood at 3.5 per cent. Yields moved to 4.2 per cent over the next month, just to mock us. In the last month or so, however, the 10-year has staged a rousing rally, pushing yields back to 3.5 per cent (despite a bad day yesterday). What has happened, in broad outline, is a combination of the two scenarios we outlined.
The Fed has pivoted to smaller hikes, and the market has interpreted chair Jay Powell’s recent comment that “my colleagues and I do not want to overtighten” as a nod to the end of tightening. At the same time, the yield curve remains inverted and the shadow of recession hangs over every portfolio. Greg Obenshain of Verdad Capital sums up:
You have inverted yield curves, a Fed still tightening, the Fed Lending Survey indicating that lending standards are much tighter, all indicative of tight money and oncoming recession. Even in the 1970s, bonds rallied in recessions. Given that inverted yield curves are THE signal of recession and given that bonds have sold off so much and tend to do well in recessions, it would be surprising if people weren’t taking a hard look at Treasurys. Add in some slowing inflation, and [the Treasury rally] makes all kinds of sense.
Everyone I spoke to about the rally noted that the market has been heavily short the entire curve and particularly the long end, positions that are now reversing. Pension funds and insurance companies globally know that rates tend to hit cyclical peaks when the curve inverts, and now that the Fed is signalling it is nearly done, they are piling in to long duration.
Recession next year is Unhedged’s base case, so the Treasury rally makes sense to us. That said, we do not think (as many do) that Powell is a closet dove. The reputational risk to him loosening while inflation is still well above the 2 per cent target is immense. In the next 12 months, Powell will be writing the top paragraphs of his obituary, and he knows it. This suggests two risks.
The first is that Powell looks at the recent stock and bond rally and sees financial conditions loosening fast, putting their effort to depress demand at risk. They may also notice, with disapproval, that the futures market has priced in two rate cuts for the second half of next year.
“The Fed wants to and needs to create material slack in the economy and in labour markets before saying ‘job done’,” Calvin Tse of BNP Paribas told us. “We’ve seen a rapid unwinding of financial conditions over the past month, so the Fed may have to do something to tighten them again — perhaps by introducing the idea that rate hikes may continue for a while.” 
We think that this (a) would be a smart thing for the Fed to do and (b) it would come as a shock, given how the market is positioned today. It could make the curve invert even farther, as the short end prices in more hikes and investors, worried about an even deeper recession, throw more money at long Treasuries.
What would be bad for long Treasuries would be a breakdown in the current trend towards lower inflation falters badly. The peak policy rate would then have to be significantly above the 4.75-5 per cent currently anticipated. If inflation is 3ish in six months’ time, and the direction of travel is down, the Fed could consider a cut. Not if it’s 4ish. 
BlackRock is worried about this. From its 2023 global outlook:
Long-term government bonds . . . historically have shielded portfolios from recession. Not this time . . . Central banks are unlikely to come to the rescue with rapid rate cuts in recessions they engineered to bring down inflation to policy targets. If anything, policy rates may stay higher for longer than the market is expecting.
Taking the other side of this argument, here is our regular interlocutor James Athey of Abrdn:
Just looking at the base effects from energy there would need to be significant upside in key core components for there not to be some significant disinflation over the coming months. The market prices headline [inflation] at around 3 by June. The way oil trades currently there are downside risks to that. Real time rental data suggests [housing costs] peaked a few months ago. And for the labour market not to weaken after the tightening we’ve already seen would be unprecedented. Of course there are upside risks, there always are, but right now I feel pretty confident that the risks are skewed to the downside.
We hope James is right. And Treasuries still make sense to us.

There is a cloud on the horizon, however: sharp increases in the cost to rent a plane.
More than half of the world’s commercial aircraft are owned or managed by leasing companies, and their rates are rising. For Airbus’s A320neo and Boeing’s 737 Max — the most sought-after single-aisle aircraft — lease rates have respectively risen 14 per cent and 20 per cent since the lows of the pandemic, according to IBA, an aviation consultancy.
The jump in rental fees is another consequence of global central banks’ push to raise interest rates as surging inflation ends an era of cheap finance. Higher interest rates mean that the specialist companies that own and hire out aircraft fleets have more costly debt. Lessors must calculate how to pass on these borrowing costs to carriers that are already dealing with ballooning higher fuel and labour expenses.
Air Lease, a Los Angeles-based lessor, last week raised $700mn through a bond offering at an interest rate of 5.85 per cent — roughly double the rate of a similar bond issuance in January.
The deal, the first such bond offering since Russia’s war in Ukraine, is “somewhat of a bellwether,” said Philip Baggaley, analyst at S&P Global. “They had to pay a lot more than they used to borrow at, but that’s the market reality.” 
Air Lease executive chair Steven Udvar-Házy said he had not seen the cost of capital increase this quickly since the 1970s, when inflation was rampant.
The rapidity of the rise makes it harder to pass higher financing costs on to airlines, but Udvar-Házy said Air Lease has started already. Airlines, whose lease rates had already risen owing to scarce aircraft supplies and strong demand, are resisting.
“Airlines are always pushing back,” he said. “I’ve never had an airline say that our lease rates are too low. It’s like a big Istanbul grand bazaar: The leasing company says 100, the airline says 80, and we hope to negotiate at 99 and a half.”
Many airlines asked lessors for financial relief during the pandemic. But they are back in the black as air travel has roared back. “So it’s very hard to plead poverty,” Udvar-Házy said. “Yes, we’re going to work with our customers, but they read the newspapers, they see what’s going on. The cost of financing is going up.”
Several airlines referred to rising interest rates with regard to leases in their recent earnings calls.
Wizz Air of Hungary told investors last month that it benefited from having “fixed interest rate structures financing 94 per cent of its existing fleet”. In the US, Frontier Airlines chief financial officer Jimmy Dempsey said it had financed 35 out of its next 37 aircraft deliveries, “and we’ve done it in a way that has capped interest rate exposure on a lot of these leases”.
Andy Cronin, chief executive of Irish leasing company Avolon, said lease rates were moving upwards for both new and used aircraft in response to the undersupply of aircraft in the market, rising interest rates and the withdrawal from the market of certain lessors, in particular some from Asia.
Surging interest rates have hit the market for bonds composed by bundles of plane leases. The value of deals for such asset-backed securities is expected to total $1.1bn in 2022 compared to $9.2bn last year, revealing a changed market, said Ishka Global aviation consultant Paul O’Driscoll.
“Nobody wants to buy a package of leased aircraft because they have [quantitative-easing] era leases, while investors can get [quantitative-tightening] era yields by providing capital for new lease transactions,” he said, referring to central banks’ sudden move to tighten monetary policy.
Tense bargaining between lessors and airlines will be limited somewhat because only 15 to 20 per cent of a lessors’ fleet comes up for lease renewal in any given year.
“Current market lease rates for new aircraft are up 5 to 10 per cent. But that is not the 30 per cent that might be required given the interest rate increases we have seen this year. Lessors will therefore face some [profit] margin compression,” said Rob Morris, head of global consultancy at Ascend by Cirium.
As they enter into negotiations, leasing executives point out that airlines have not hesitated to raise prices for their own customers. Average US airfares were up 22 per cent year on year in the second quarter of 2022, government data show.
“Airlines are under tremendous cost increase pressure, but they’ve been able to pass it on to the traveller in higher ticket prices,” Udvar-Házy said. “So Air Lease is not a sinner in this respect. We’re simply trying to deal with economic realities.”

https://www.ft.com/content/40a1fe59-da38-40bc-97d7-397d2babe6fc,How will ESG funds make money next year?,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7e0d9451-24a7-439c-9526-d43acf2486c7.jpg?source=next&fit=scale-down&dpr=2&width=240,Alice Ross,2022-12-09,"With markets uncertain, picking winning stocks and funds will be tough in 2023","There have not been many places for investors to hide from the equity sell-off this year and sustainable funds are no exception. The MSCI World index, for example, is down 14 per cent and its environmental social and governance (ESG) counterpart has lost 15 per cent.
One of the few sectors that did well as a result of the war in Ukraine — energy — is largely shunned by sustainable funds. If you didn’t have Occidental Petroleum or Exxon in your portfolio like billionaire investor Warren Buffett, the odds are you’ve underperformed the market. Meanwhile, tech stocks, which ESG funds tend to own a lot of, had a terrible year.
So, assuming they won’t go down the dubious path of arguing that oil and gas stocks are now ESG-friendly because they contribute to energy security, how do sustainable fund managers plan to make money in 2023?
Most of the managers I spoke to for this column think the financial tide has turned, and not in a good way. The easy money just isn’t there any more, whether you’re investing sustainably or not. The rising tide of quantitative easing that helped to lift pretty much all equities over the past decade is gone. Higher interest rates and recessions are back. Many sustainable funds had a focus on so-called growth stocks — companies that are growing quickly, like tech companies or some renewables. But growth has had a bad year and instead value stocks — those undervalued by the market — have done better.
Yet asset managers are optimistic that sustainable funds will find opportunities to make money next year.
One obvious area is clean energy. Perhaps surprisingly, the sector didn’t do that well this year. Despite governments vowing to pivot away from Russian oil and gas and invest more in renewables, shorter-term effects got in the way. Wind energy companies such as Denmark’s Orsted and Spain’s Iberdrola suffered from supply chain issues. Higher interest rates played a role: renewable companies tend to have a lot of upfront costs that require borrowing, so when costs go up, they suffer. The good news is that the longer term case for renewables remains.
Lucas White, portfolio manager of the GMO Climate Fund, reckons the prospects for clean energy companies are much better now than at the start of the year. A lot of this is due to US President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which hands out significant tax credits to clean energy companies.
He is applying a quality bias to clean energy companies — avoiding more speculative stocks such as hydrogen companies that are not yet profitable in favour of more mature companies priced at reasonable levels. Companies with a unique advantage are also good picks in a more difficult market. First Solar, a US solar panels maker, has a product that works well in warm desert conditions, for example, making it one of the few solar companies with a differentiated offering. Biofuel companies, he believes, are a neglected niche and look very cheap.
Tom Atkinson, a portfolio manager at Axa Investment Managers, who works on the company’s clean economy strategy, is keen on US agriculture equipment makers, particularly those in sustainable or precision farming. Water is a key area that is undervalued, he thinks, with farmers under pressure to improve their efficiency and companies needing to treat and reduce water waste.
Other fund managers are looking at less obviously sustainable sectors, such as banks. Banks do play a crucial but often overlooked role in the energy transition, through lending to higher polluting sectors such as oil and gas companies. Mike Fox at Royal London reckons that financials have cleaned up their act in recent years: they offer simpler products to consumers, and they’re getting better at disclosing their loan books — which is key to being able to understand the carbon footprint of a company.
Fox thinks banks have the power to force consumer change through financial incentives. Lloyds, for example, offers lower mortgage rates for homeowners who make their homes more energy efficient. Banks with more complex business models, such as HSBC, are harder to analyse from an ESG perspective and less likely to be suitable, he thinks.
Simon Clements at Liontrust thinks that valuations right now are “pretty appealing”. He thinks that any recession will be consumer led but that businesses will fare better. “Businesses are in better shape and they will generally invest to improve their own efficiency and profitability,” he argues — which is good news for energy efficiency stocks.
The circular economy — where products are reused or recycled and waste is reduced — is on many sustainable fund managers’ radar. Jon Forster at Impax Environmental Markets rates software companies such as US-based Altair that help to make product manufacturing more efficient, as well as companies that use sustainable materials like Austria’s Lenzing or Royal DSM of The Netherlands, while equipment rental companies such as Herc Rentals help promote the sharing economy.
Healthcare also has enthusiasts among sustainable fund managers. Companies are likely to be more resilient in a recession and valuations are relatively cheap
Forster says this year was not great for sustainable companies in the buildings, energy efficiency and water infrastructure sectors that were exposed to construction, where growth has slowed this year due to higher interest rates and waning consumer confidence. Swedish heat pump manufacturer NIBE, he says, was a “prime rotation victim”: it was already priced high and fared poorly as investors sold off expensive growth stocks. But he thinks that will change next year as investors focus more on the longer term need for energy efficiency. NIBE could benefit from the drive to decarbonise heating on the back of the war in Ukraine. Dutch companies Signify, which makes LED lighting, and Aalberts, in water infrastructure, will also have a better year, he thinks.
Healthcare also has enthusiasts among sustainable fund managers. Companies are likely to be more resilient in a recession and valuations are relatively cheap. Forster likes Cryoport, which makes reusable containers instead of Styrofoam to transport biogenic material, and Repligen, which helps drug manufacturing use less water.
Overall, fund managers think diversification is key in 2023, rather than the rising tide strategy of the past decade of simply buying growth stocks, sitting back and watching them go up. Royal London’s Fox reckons fund managers will have to learn or relearn key skills from the 1990s: price matters, and so do economic cycles.
That means next year we should find out who is actually good at sustainable investing in a bear market. With both institutional and retail investors becoming more savvy about greenwashing and growth no longer a given, sustainable fund managers will have to work hard to prove their worth.

Funds have seen net monthly outflows for most of this year, with modest inflows reported only around the end of the financial year in April, when some investors top up their tax-free Isa holdings, according to data released this week by the Investment Association, an industry body. 
Uncertainty has gripped the market in a climate of rising interest rates, high financial asset prices, inflation and recession. Even in 2008, net retail sales were a positive £4.8bn. Net sales were £43.6bn last year.
“We typically see retail flows turn net negative in periods of volatility or crisis,” said Sarah Ruggins, head of multi-asset research at wealth manager St James’s Place. She warned investors over trying to time withdrawals, saying “the largest rebounds come immediately after the largest drawdowns”.
Outflows have been broadly based, hitting equity, fixed income and money market funds. Despite withdrawals halving month-on-month in October to £3.7bn, sell-offs continued for all main asset classes, except passive funds.
The figures for October suggest the market settled slightly following the gilts crisis triggered by former prime minister Liz Truss’s September “mini” Budget, though the cost of living crisis and a looming recession next year continue to weigh heavily on consumer confidence. 
Sell-offs in equity funds hit £17.3bn in the first 10 months of the year, with September the largest single month of withdrawals over the period at £4.95bn. Short-term flows between asset classes suggested a growing appetite for passive funds, with £1.4bn in net inflows in October.
With investors worried about the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, outflows of £4.5bn in European equity funds were higher than Asia and North America.
“Alternatives, bonds and equities have all had a torrid time in the year to date, and there’s been few places to hide, even for ‘cautiously’ positioned funds,” said Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at trading platform Interactive Investor.
Low-risk portfolios have not been a sure-fire source of returns for investors this year, with Vanguard’s LifeStrategy 60% Equity Fund down 7.49 per cent in the year-to-date, having experienced double-digit returns in two of the previous three years.
Ruggins said withdrawals were concerning, with some investors requiring ready access to capital. She noted individuals’ portfolios should be better diversified to lower-risk exposure and weather short-term disruption.
Central bankers’ appetite for further monetary tightening into next year has made investors wary of possible market turbulence affecting returns after the bond market turmoil in the autumn.
However, analysts suggested UK government and corporate bonds had been reset after a decade of steady yields ended suddenly, hit by rising interest rates. Newly-elevated returns available on bonds could be attractive, they said.
“As conditions shift, a higher interest rate environment means investing in bonds will become more attractive than it has been over the last decade,” said Chris Cumming, IA chief executive.
“Investors will need to navigate the changing investment landscape, and we may see further shifts in the pattern of fund flows,” he added.

Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.8 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.1 per cent. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 and London’s FTSE 100 both fell 0.2 per cent.
The S&P 500 had fallen for the previous five consecutive sessions as stronger than expected jobs and services sector data have chipped away at investors’ conviction about the direction of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate rises.
Fed chair Jay Powell last week suggested that the Fed could slow its aggressive pace of interest rate increases in December, but also warned that the US central bank had a long way to go in its fight against inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 0.5 percentage points in December, which would end a run of four 0.75 percentage point increases.

Futures markets indicate that an overwhelming majority of investors have already priced in such a move, but the mood on Wall Street remains skittish ahead of November’s inflation report and the Fed’s final meeting of the year next week.
“Just last week the market was coming around to the possibility that the Fed might actually pull off the fabled soft landing, but recently the market is returning to the belief that a recession is likely,” said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management.
“I think this back-and-forth thinking is simply a product of uncertainty and the year-long bear market,” Zigmont added. “Investors are so beat up that they are less comfortable holding a view without clear evidence.”
The Treasury market sold off on Thursday and continues to flash warning signs of a slowdown in economic growth, with the gap between short- and long-term US borrowing costs on Wednesday reaching its widest point since 1981. The two-year Treasury yield added 0.06 percentage points to reach 4.31 per cent, while the 10-year yield rose by 0.07 percentage points to 3.49 per cent. Yields rise as prices fall.
Hong Kong stocks reversed some of their steep falls from the previous session as the territory followed mainland China in easing some Covid-19 restrictions.

The Hang Seng index gained 3.4 per cent, after a fall of 3.2 per cent in the previous session. The gains were broad, with consumer-focused stocks, healthcare companies and tech shares leading the way. Real estate and financial groups also gained while “haven” shares, such as utilities, lagged.
Sixty stocks rose and 12 declined, ensuring the index remains on track for its biggest quarterly rise since the final three months of 2020. Mainland China stocks were more muted, however, with the CSI 300 index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed shares flat.
Investors were encouraged by a report of further easing of Hong Kong’s Covid curbs, which was confirmed when a health official told a briefing that isolation periods for victims and their close contacts would be shortened from seven days to five. Discussions on ending outdoor mask-wearing as a requirement were also reported, but the policy will officially remain in place.
“On the one hand you’ve had this almost euphoric reaction to the easing of Covid restrictions in China, and more support for the property sector,” said Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities. “But there are still constraints here over the efficacy of vaccines, over ICU capacity, on the number of unvaccinated, which suggest we could have slower progress than markets are predicting.”

That is a question that global regulators urgently need to ponder, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
The BIS’s economists have recently delved into the entrails of the bank’s foreign exchange survey to track the trend in dollar swaps — the derivatives deals that enable investors to exchange dollars for other currencies, for a specific period, before swapping these back.
A layperson might assume this is a transparent corner of finance, given that the dollar underpins so much of the global industry and these swaps are used by most large companies and investment groups.
Not so. As the latest BIS quarterly report notes, forward dollar payment obligations “do not appear on balance sheets and are missing in standard debt statistics”, because they are not classified as a “loan” in accounting systems. They are off-balance sheet — in other words, a black hole.
And that hole is astonishingly big. The BIS detective work suggests that there are “$80tn-plus” in outstanding obligations to pay US dollars in FX swaps — or forwards — and currency swaps. This has doubled in the past decade, with a $5tn churn each day.
Some $39tn of this involve non-American banks, and another $26tn non-American, non-bank entities such as hedge funds and insurance companies. Moreover, the non-bank category has grown rapidly, dwarfing on-balance sheet risks, and is often associated with maturity mismatches.
Thankfully, there is no sign of current stress. But history shows that FX swaps markets are “vulnerable to funding squeezes”, the BIS notes. This is because when shocks hit, investors worry about how to repay these dollar obligations, creating wild price gyrations.
And while the Federal Reserve has quelled panic in the past by letting other central banks supply dollars, the black hole means that the dollar swaps market was “backstopped in 2008 and 2020 by central banks acting on little information about who owed the debt”. The BIS is now (quite sensibly) begging central bankers to plug the data gap.
I hope the Fed and others will heed the call. Regulators have already created a data hub for globally systemic banks, which tracks some of these flows. But policymakers should not stop there. One dirty secret of global finance is that this $80tn black hole is far from being the only place where we need more sunlight.
The sphere of private credit is also startling murky. So is the behaviour of the Chinese credit cycle; as a new paper from the Fed notes. This matters because Chinese credit conditions have big spillover implications for global asset markets, including the dollar-based one.
But another area of surprising data fog is Treasuries which (like dollar swaps) underpin so much of the financial system. During the dramatic market turmoil of 2020, it became clear that secondary market trading structures have big vulnerabilities that were not understood — or reported — before. And while the Securities and Exchange Commission and US Treasury is trying to fix this, progress is slow.
The primary market, meanwhile, has its own transparency problems, as the economists Alexandra M. Tabova and Francis E. Warnock have recently argued. Public data shows overall bids in bond auctions and the broad patterns of foreign purchases. But it does not reveal which buyers are buying which bonds, or their price sensitivity.
This matters, they argue, given the US government’s $18tn negative foreign asset position. It needs to know “which investors will step in and buy Treasuries” against the looming spectre of higher Treasury yields while at the same time, the Federal Reserve is reducing its Treasury portfolio.
Tabova and Warnock have scoured private data sources and concluded that while non-Americans own around half of all Treasuries, their behaviour is poorly understood. To cite one example: while official statistics claim that foreign private investors were buying $3.5tn more Treasuries each year than foreign governments between 2005 and 2019, they think the latter actually bought $1tn more than the former. That is important, since foreign government purchases have recently slowed, and they have acted in a strikingly “price inelastic way” before, with much shorter portfolio durations than private investors.
The good news is that the digitisation of private data is making it easier than ever to do this type of detective work. Better still, after the 2008 global financial crisis, the US Treasury created the Office of Financial Research, which is supposed to take a holistic view of markets.
But the bad news is that OFR has faced calls to cut its budget, and it cannot hope to get better data on dollar swaps or Treasuries without help from central banks.
So let us hope that the American government (among others) treats the revelations about this $80tn black hole as a wake-up call. After all, if there was ever a moment when central bankers needed to understand the real vulnerabilities arising from dollar-linked debt, it is when the world faces geopolitical risks, economic pain and political challenges to the supremacy of the dollar. That is precisely what 2023 could bring.

https://www.ft.com/content/9d5b9126-e1ec-4e35-ace9-c25c1a39b3e3,Long-dated US bonds offer investors hope,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1a4cc7bf-ccf3-4be2-b937-efd820ec9559.jpg?source=next&fit=scale-down&dpr=2&width=240,John Redwood,2022-12-08,Central banks are now sitting on large unrealised losses ,"It’s been a bad year for bonds and shares. We have seen markets dominated by the actions of the leading central banks as they have struggled to adjust to the new reality of high and rising inflation.
I kept the bond part of the portfolio in short-dated index-linked bonds and in cash and near cash for much of the year, waiting for the US Federal Reserve and the other leading central banks to get on with increasing interest rates and forcing bond prices down.
More recently I have put money into longer-dated US Treasuries as the yields offer better value.
Earlier, I took the share portfolio out of stocks on the tech-orientated Nasdaq and cut exposure to the growth sectors that were subsequently hit hard in the sell-off.
The share part of the portfolio has lost a bit less by holding a better diversified world share exposure. But it was still affected by the big change of mood and outlook and the widespread global share market falls. The FT portfolio as a whole was down 11.4 per cent for the year, on December 1.
The year 2022 has reminded investors how dependent asset values are on supportive central banks. The great bull runs of recent years were fuelled by huge bond purchase programmes by the central banks, which paid ever- crazier prices to depress interest rates to around zero.
I never saw the advantage of buying bonds that offered no income in the hope someone would buy them from you for an even higher price. The central banks bought many bonds well above their repayment value. This means these banks are now sitting on large unrealised losses which will crystallise when they sell their bonds in the market in so-called quantitative tightening programmes, or when the bonds are repaid on maturity.
The central banks are also losing money by holding the bonds, as the income they receive on them is now less than the interest they have to pay out on the reserves deposited with them by the commercial banks. These reserves are inflated by the cost of the bonds the central banks bought being now reflected in commercial bank deposits.
The Fed and the European Central Bank were slow to stop the bond buying and they have been slow to get interest rates up to the levels needed to bring inflation down to the 2 per cent target.
This has strung out the misery in the markets and led to volatility around speculation on just how high rates will have to go and for how long. The recent Santa rally has come from many investors hoping that the Fed is nearing peak rates and will have to start to reduce borrowing costs as early as sometime next year in response to economic slowdown or recession.
It is true that money supply has lurched from far too expansionary to not growing at all. At the same time the US regulators are looking at requiring commercial banks to hold more capital, to make it more difficult for people and businesses to borrow. It should not take much more Fed action to bring price rises down. They need to avoid overdoing the severity of their policy. A slowdown followed by a pause in rate rises will be needed in the new year.
The refusal of the advanced country central banks to take money and credit growth seriously has added to the magnitude of the errors they made over inflation.
While, as the banks say, Russian president Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine led to a big spike in energy prices, inflation was well above target before the war began.
In China and Japan inflation has stayed much lower than in the US and Europe despite those countries being large energy importers. It is true the velocity of circulation or frequency of use of money can vary and might offset changes in the quantity, but it does appear that the places that boosted money and credit most now have higher inflation. We are all paying a high price for the inflationary errors.
Establishment wisdom tells us that central banks cannot go bust. That is just as well, as many of them have unrealised losses on their bonds many times their capital base. It is likely various central banks will be reporting negative capital as the bonds repay or are sold at a loss.
The theory goes that they can always create money to pay their bills, unlike any other company which needs to replenish share capital and reserves or cease trading.
Different accounting treatments will be used. The Bank of England has no problem because it will receive cash for all the losses made from the Treasury, which constantly tops up its capital.
The Fed has said it will report the losses and create a deferred asset on its balance sheet to offset them. This is said to represent future profits it expects to make sometime. The European Central Bank will require the national central banks in the Euro system to absorb most of the losses. If necessary these banks will have to be recapitalised by their governments.
Eurozone officials say there is now a transmission protection instrument available. This would allow the ECB to return to buying bonds in countries facing bond price falls and high interest rates compared to other member states. They claim they would not use this to help finance any government refusing to accept the disciplines of the EU and eurozone over deficits and general economic policy.
These pressures are likely to make the ECB more wary of raising rates too much and more reluctant than the US to go selling lots of bonds at a loss.
Bonds in the US now offer better value. I will add more to the portfolio as we approach the slowdown and the coming pause in US rate rises
European rates remain unrealistically low for the inflationary circumstances. Policy will be more guided by keeping the euro states on side, by trying to avoid big divergences in rates between different countries, and by a reluctance to worsen the downturn.
In contrast, the US remains wedded to hawkish words and deeds to get inflation down quickly. Next year it is very likely political priorities will evolve in the US to show more concern about incomes, jobs and activity, which will lead to a mellowing at the Fed.
As the old year draws to an end, weary investors are looking for better prospects next year. Bonds in the US now offer better value. I will add more to the portfolio as we approach the slowdown and the coming pause in US rate rises.
Shares are well down and pointing to the downturn in growth and profits to come. January will see more debate about when governments shift from mainly fighting inflation, to combating a downturn that threatens to be too long and too deep.
It will be time to consider the share portfolio when we have a bit more data on the extent and nature of the downturn. We should still expect downward revisions to forecasts of profits as more sectors experience the kind of problems we can clearly see in falling US housing starts and in home sales numbers.

The 270,000-member scheme, which has a £4bn deficit, said it had become “more cautious” in how it managed liquidity following September’s gilt market crisis. That forced thousands of retirement schemes to sell assets, such as bonds and equities, to meet collateral calls.
Like many defined-benefit plans, the BT scheme used liability-driven investing (LDI) strategies to help mitigate the risks of interest rate and inflation movements on liabilities. Its pension payments run to about £2.5bn a year.
The value of its assets fell by around £11bn as it used cash, gilts and sold equity holdings, to meet urgent collateral calls on its LDI strategies when gilt yields soared following the bungled “mini” Budget from Liz Truss’s government.
In a written submission to MPs investigating the gilt market turmoil, BT Pension Scheme Management said changes it had made to its LDI strategy in response to the crisis could have consequences for the telecoms group.
“We have become more cautious in how we manage the scheme’s liquidity and have increased the collateral buffer to which we operate,” said BTPSM. “This will position the scheme to better weather any further volatility in the gilt market but will also reduce the expected returns from our assets.”
It added that, should expected returns fall below a certain level, it may need “more support from BT in future valuations than previously anticipated”.
If BTPSM did turn to its parent company, it could put the former monopoly in a difficult financial situation at a time when it is already seeking to tighten its belt because of soaring inflation. BT, which employs nearly 100,000 people, recently said it had increased its 2025 target for cost savings by a fifth, from £2.5bn to £3bn, and that it may have to cut its headcount.
“Inflation is pushing us hard,” said BT’s chief executive Philip Jansen during the company’s second-quarter results last month.
BT said in a statement: “We remain on track with our plan to eradicate the BT Pension Scheme funding deficit by 2030, despite the recent volatility in the gilt markets and subsequent impact on the LDI market.”
This year, BT spent £1bn on deficit payments to its pension scheme, and is set to pay another £1bn next year. However, the figure is scheduled to taper off in the following years, down to £180mn by 2032.
Recommended
In its submission, BTPSM said: “The pace of change and the dysfunction in the gilt market had presented significant operational and liquidity challenges.”
However, it had a “robust liquidity process” and ran a “substantial gilts and cash buffer” that is used to meet collateral calls in the first instance. It had also sold equities to generate cash.
In its annual report published in October, BTPSM said gilt market volatility reduced the scheme’s assets by £11bn before the Bank of England intervened to shore up the market.
“Whilst the value of the scheme’s assets has fallen over this period, there has been no worsening in our estimated funding position,” said the scheme. “Our hedges have performed as expected.”
BTPSM defended the use of LDI — now subject to marketwide scrutiny from policymakers — saying the strategy was “key” in managing the volatility of its funding position.
It noted that, at the time of the last triennial valuation in 2020, the scheme’s funding deficit had been £8bn.
“We estimate that, in the absence of the LDI hedging programme, the deficit would have been £7.6bn higher (ie £15bn or more) and that would have required BT to pay significant additional contributions to repair the deficit,” said BTPSM.

The two-year Treasury yield traded on Wednesday at 4.2 per cent, while the 10-year yield stood at 3.4 per cent, bringing the difference between the two to 0.84 percentage points. The pattern, known as a yield curve “inversion”, has preceded every US economic downturn of the past 50 years.
The deepening of the inversion comes after a report last week showing the US economy continued adding jobs at a robust pace in November and an important survey indicating activity in the vast services sector is continuing to grow rapidly.
While the data paint an upbeat picture of the state of the economy, some investors are worried that it will also encourage the Fed to keep pushing interest rates higher next year, after taking them from near zero to a range of 3.75 to 4 per cent so far in 2022. Higher borrowing costs, in turn, are expected to heap pressure on the economy and potentially trigger a recession.
“The market had been betting that the Fed would be forced to slow down. The past year has taught us that the market has been wrong over and over again on this assumption,” said Edward Al-Hussainy, a senior analyst at Columbia Threadneedle.
Recommended
Shifts in the US bond market also show investors moving more in alignment with what the Fed has said it expects for the coming year. Though the yield curve has been flattening all year, it bounced off of lows in late November and investors last week began pricing in two interest rate cuts by the end of 2023, both indicating a loosening in monetary policy.
This gap between the Fed and the market was especially evident after a speech by chair Jay Powell last week in which he signalled that although the US central bank would slow its pace of rate increases at its December meeting, it would do so to allow rates to remain higher for longer. Markets focused on the first piece and not the second.
After the release on Friday of the US jobs report, however, the steepening move in the yield curve unravelled, though rate cuts next year are still priced in. Futures markets currently suggest the “terminal” federal funds rate, or the peak in this cycle, will be about 5 per cent in May, from expectations of as low as 4 per cent in September.
“The [November] payrolls report reminded us that the job market remains in a very good place, and we’re expecting to see that reflected in a higher terminal rate in the dots,” said Ben Jeffery, a US rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets, referring to the Fed’s quarterly poll of officials on where the economy and monetary policy will be in the years ahead — also known as the “dot plot”. The next dot plot will be released at the Fed’s December meeting.
The most basic signal sent by the yield curve inversion is that investors believe the Fed’s increases in short-term rates will be successful in sharply slowing inflation. The magnitude of this inversion then reflects both the dramatic pace of rate increases, and the fact that the Fed has stuck with that pace even as investors have shifted their expectations on inflation and growth.
“We think the shape of the yield curve is a measure of the extent to which monetary policy can tighten, and the market clearly thinks that tightness is going to persist for quite some time,” said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America.
Jonathan Cohn at Credit Suisse added that the deepening yield curve inversion suggests investors believe the Fed is committed to “inflation moderation even if it must sacrifice forward-looking growth or recession”.
Recommended
In a December survey conducted by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in partnership with the Financial Times, 85 per cent of economists said they expected the National Bureau of Economic Research — the arbiter of recession in the US — will declare one by next year.
Though the yield curve has been a reliable indicator of recession, the information conveyed by the depth and extent of the inversion is up for debate.
“The inverted yield curve is actually a pretty good signal of recession, without providing information as to its depth or severity,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
“In this case, the inversion is probably telling us more about inflation and the direction of inflation risks than the depths or severity of a recession.” 
While strategists such as LeBas argue that the degree of the yield curve inversion may not directly predict the extent of the coming recession, the current deepening could have broader ramifications if it leads to changes in investor behaviour.
“The more important aspect of the yield curve is what it does to risk-taking,” said Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer for fixed income at PGIM. “It’s a self-reinforcing mechanism.”

Investors have completely unwound last year’s purchases of European equity exchange traded funds amid deepening gloom as to the continent’s prospects.
They pulled a net $1.7bn from European equity ETFs in November, puncturing two months of relative calm, according to data from BlackRock. The resumed selling has taken net outflows from the sector since March to a cumulative $27bn, reversing inflows of $27.2bn witnessed during 2021.
The outflows are striking given that money has continued to pour into ETFs focused on US and emerging market equities, and that there is a structural “bid” for ETFs which are seizing market share from more traditional mutual funds at an ever-accelerating pace.
The exodus from European stocks has come despite the continent’s bourses outperforming on a relative basis this year, with the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50 index down 9.6 per cent year to date, a more muted loss than the 17.8 per cent fall in the S&P 500 and 21 per cent slide in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, although the euro’s 6.8 per cent decline against the dollar will have worsened the picture for US-based investors.
Despite this, sentiment towards Europe remains grim, particularly among the foreign investors that led the charge into the continent last year.
“Because of developed Europe’s proximity to Ukraine, international investors have avoided Europe,” said Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at 7 Investment Management. “Economically, the impact of high gas prices and the higher likelihood of a recession has deterred investors.”
“US investors have more of a home bias than they have had in recent years because of the global economic challenges,” added Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi. “There is an investor perception that the European recession will be deeper than in the US.
“There is greater confidence in a recovery in emerging markets than developed non-US markets.”
VettaFi’s own data suggested the picture was nuanced, however.
Among US-listed Europe-focused ETFs, some single-country funds, such as iShares MSCI UK ETF (EWU) and iShares MSCI France (EWQ) have taken in money this year, $594mn and $317mn respectively, while the sister iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG) has shipped $550mn.
“US investors are taking a broader perspective on investing in the US as opposed to a more targeted appetite across Europe,” Rosenbluth said.
“The UK has seen some inflows,” agreed Karim Chedid, head of investment strategy for BlackRock’s iShares arm in the Emea region.
Chedid attributed European bourses smaller losses this year in part to the weaker euro, which “has boosted export-orientated companies which form a big part of the Euro Stoxx 50”, meaning earnings have held up better.
He also believed European stocks were “significantly under-owned” by global investors, but was not turning more positive on the region.
“We need to see that the valuations have changed enough for a turnaround,” Chedid said. “When we get to that point, there is a lot of positioning to catch up.”
Change is afoot in fixed-income markets, however. BlackRock’s data show net inflows of $17.1bn into corporate bond ETFs in November, outpacing those to government bond ETFs ($11.9bn) for the first time this year.
The turnround has been particularly stark for high-yield bond ETFs. As of September 21 they had had cumulative outflows of $21bn this year; by the end of November that had shrunk to just $5bn. Cumulative inflows to investment-grade corporate bond ETFs have risen from $23bn to $36bn over the same period.
Chedid said this “remarkable” resurgence in flows was particularly noticeable for corporate bond ETFs with longer duration, another sign of greater comfort with risk.
“We are starting to see, especially for Emea, full duration exposure taken in credit, much more than we have in rates,” he said.
Rosenbluth also saw strong demand for riskier bonds, with the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) attracting $3.6bn in November, the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) $1bn and the iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (USHY) $592mn, even as lower-risk products such as the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (SHY) and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV) have seen outflows.
“These products have been largely out of favour,” he said. “Investors are both willing and needing to take on more risk to get higher yields. If the [US Federal Reserve] was continuing to hike you would get paid for the flight to safety to Treasury products. If it is getting closer to stopping, take on more credit risk.”
Chedid also believed this switch made sense. Investors were “cautious” about taking duration risk through government bond ETFs given that, with inflation remaining elevated “the central bank path is hard to call”, he said.
While unexpectedly aggressive rate increases would also be likely to weigh on corporate bonds, he believed that “some investors are taking the view, given where spreads are, that they are being compensated for duration risk”, whereas in government bonds they are not.
“It is more of a carry trade. Spreads [over government bonds] will not necessarily narrow but they won’t widen further, so you are just locking in the higher yield,” Chedid argued.
In recent years, he said, “bonds were more of a ballast in portfolios, not for yield, because that was very low across the board. Today bonds are for income again. That is a huge shift as we head into 2023.”

With $7.1tn under management and more than 30mn customers as of October 31, Vanguard is the second-largest global money manager after BlackRock. The group said on Wednesday that it was resigning from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, whose members have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Vanguard, which mainly manages passive funds that track market indices, said the alliance’s full-throated commitment to fighting climate change had resulted “in confusion about the views of individual investment firms”.
“We have decided to withdraw from NZAM so that we can provide the clarity our investors desire about the role of index funds and about how we think about material risks, including climate-related risks — and to make clear that Vanguard speaks independently on matters of importance to our investors,” the Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement.
NZAM was founded in December 2020 and had 291 members managing $66tn in assets as of November. Last year NZAM joined an umbrella climate finance organisation, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz) upon its launch last year under Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor. Vanguard will exit both groups.
In a statement, NZAM said Vanguard’s decision was regrettable.
“It is unfortunate that political pressure is impacting this crucial economic imperative and attempting to block companies from effectively managing risks,” said Kirsten Snow Spalding of Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental groups and also a founding partner of NZAM.
Most of the largest global asset managers belong to NZAM, including BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan Asset Management and Legal & General. Notable holdouts include Fidelity Investments and Pimco, both based in the US.
Vanguard said the move had been in the works for several months. It will continue to offer products that use environmental, social and governance investing factors and net zero products to investors who want them. Vanguard will also still ask the companies it invests in how they plan to address climate risks.
Last month, a group of Republican attorneys-general asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not to renew Vanguard’s authorisation to buy shares in US utilities. They cited its NZAM membership as evidence that it was trying to influence corporate policy rather than being a passive investor.
That move is part of a larger attack by Republicans on ESG investing. Several Republican states have pulled cash management and other investment accounts from BlackRock, which has under founder Larry Fink been outspoken about the need to take into account climate change in investing. Texas comptroller Glenn Hegar said NZAM membership was one of the factors he used to compile a list of organisations he accused of “boycotting” fossil fuels.
Recommended
Republican state attorneys-general have also demanded that Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo turn over information about their involvement in the banking arm of Gfanz.
Environmental groups accused Vanguard of duplicity after its announcement.
“Vanguard has never been serious about mitigating climate risk,” said Jessye Waxman, an official with the Sierra Club’s fossil-free finance campaign. For Vanguard, “joining NZAM was just an exercise in greenwashing”.
At least two pension funds, Cbus Super and Bundespensionskasse, have left the asset owner section of Gfanz, while investment consultancy Meketa has left another section. Several Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America threatened to pull out over the summer because they were concerned that they could be sued over increasingly stringent decarbonisation commitments.
Gfanz responded by weakening its alignment with UN climate goals that called for members to roughly halve the emissions they are responsible for by 2030.

Battle lines have been drawn in America’s latest culture war, with Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, its general. His most recent salvo against what he describes as “woke capitalism” was fired against BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager. Its provocation was to invest at least some of its $8tn assets under management according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles and to tell companies to think about climate risk. This, according to DeSantis and Florida’s chief financial officer, flouts BlackRock’s fiduciary duty to prioritise returns above all else. Yet to try to tell a fund manager which companies it can and cannot invest in is to politicise business decisions in just the way DeSantis purports to be rallying against.
Florida pledged this month to pull as much as $2bn in long-term securities and short-term funds from BlackRock. DeSantis already led a resolution to stop the state’s pension funds from considering ESG when investing workers’ retirement savings. The move follows his attacks against other big businesses he deems too progressive, including Disney’s stance on LGBTQ issues — which cost the company, at least temporarily, its ability to run its own private government around its Orlando theme park. This playbook underscores why DeSantis is emerging as the great new hope of the Republican right, and why the odds are narrowing that he may beat Donald Trump to the party’s nomination for president. DeSantis possesses all of Trump’s prowess for tub-thumping politicking with little of his baggage.
But Florida is merely following other Republican states. About $1bn has been withdrawn from BlackRock by red states that argue ESG harms their economies and state pensions. Attorneys-general from 19 Republican states have targeted BlackRock for prioritising “activism” over fiduciary duty to their state pension funds.
The moves are pure political theatre. Regardless, for BlackRock, they have created a policy nightmare and a patchwork of liability across the US, let alone the rest of the world. There are signs that such posturing is having its desired effect. Vanguard, a rival to BlackRock, announced on Wednesday that it is leaving the financial alliance that aims to tackle climate change and which has attracted Republican ire.
Financially, the moves risk harming the ordinary working people that DeSantis and the 19 state attorneys-general claim to be fighting for. If pension funds have to sell their holdings to exit BlackRock during the current downturn in the market, that will only lock in losses for pension holders. States could face lawsuits if pension holders took a hit.
BlackRock is a natural target, not only due to its sheer size — it manages five of the top 20 US sustainable funds — but also because of the outspokenness of its founder, Larry Fink, on climate change; something that has made enemies in oil-heavy states such as Texas. Yet BlackRock’s ESG credentials have been questioned by the other end of the political spectrum for not going far enough. Some of its strategies allow for investment in fossil fuel companies as a way to further the transition to cleaner energy.
There are obvious issues with ESG, which has grown to be a $40tn industry where greenwashing and other cynical practices have emerged. But sustainable investing’s tension with money managers’ fiduciary duty is less clear cut. BlackRock argues that ignoring climate change risks investments over the long term. It is an argument that may need to be settled in court. Until then, in the manufactured war between big business and politics, it is ordinary pension holders who are caught in the crossfire.

Nicolai Tangen, chief executive of the $1.3tn Norwegian oil fund, told the Financial Times’ Global Boardroom event that the fund would become more aggressive on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues as well as aim to be a more contrarian and long-term investor.
“Yes, we can be [more vocal] and I think we will be . . . we can vote more against the companies where we have different expectations about how they behave,” Tangen said in London, a day before the fund unveils its new mid-term strategy.
Tangen’s words serve as a warning to corporates worldwide as the oil fund on average owns 1.5 per cent of every listed company.
The Norwegian fund, which is financed by the Scandinavian country’s oil and gas revenues and has increased in size sixfold since the 2008 financial crisis, has become more active in recent years by releasing its voting intentions five days ahead of annual meetings.
Tangen, a former hedge fund manager, warned the directors and boards of companies without a target to reach net zero emissions that the fund would “absolutely” vote against them.
“Only 10 per cent of companies have a clear [net] zero target already in place,” Tangen said, although he added that accounted for about a third of emissions from the 9,000 companies the fund owns shares in.
On executive pay, he warned that in the US the average top chief executive is paid close to $15mn at a time of the cost of living crisis.
“Executive pay and corporate greed has just reached a level that is really unhealthy,” Tangen said.
He added that US investors were unwilling to hold companies to account, in large part because their own top bosses were paid so much.
“That is why they are not so vocal. If you are in charge of an asset management organisation and you make an absolute killing yourself you are not going to criticise the other CEOs,” Tangen stressed.
The fund believes executive pay should be more long term and allied with shareholder interests rather than use incentive plans whose targets are often watered down such as during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Recommended
The fund, which was set up to ensure Norway’s petroleum revenues are enjoyed by future generations, is also seeking to exploit its long-term nature more in an effort to boost returns even as Tangen warns the next few years will offer meagre gains for investors.
“We can be more contrarian, ie do the opposite of other people, because when other people sell we can buy and vice versa. There is some scope to tweak that further,” he said.
“We can be even more long term in how we invest because we have a 30 to 100-year timeframe and I’m not sure we are using that to the full.”
Tangen said he saw a “continuation of difficult markets” in 2023 and added there was a risk that central banks failed to temper the current high inflation. “Inflation feeds inflation. It is difficult to get it back down.”

Their tightening cycles are now at or near an end. For investors in local currency bonds, rising prices could come sooner than many expect.
Policymakers know that “transitory” or not, inflation must be met head-on. Brazil began tightening in March 2021, 12 months before the Fed. From 2 per cent then, its policy rate is now 13.75 per cent. Inflation peaked above 12 per cent in April. In October it was 6.5 per cent.
Chile tightened from 0.5 per cent in July 2021 to 11.25 per cent in October. Headline inflation has turned the corner and is 12.8 per cent; core inflation is 10.8 per cent. The central bank will probably hold firm until April.
Mexico tightened from 4 per cent in June 2021 to 10 per cent last month. Headline and core inflation are both 8.4 per cent. Banxico has signalled a further increase to 10.5 per cent.
Brazil — where core inflation is higher than the headline figure and a fiscal expansion is expected — is the least likely to spring any surprises. The central bank has signalled its intention to keep rates high. No rate cut is expected before June.
Elsewhere, stripping out volatile fuel and food prices suggests there is room to cut.
Manik Narain, EM strategist at UBS, prepared a measure of “core-core” inflation to gauge demand in 18 countries by stripping out services with high food and fuel components such as eating out and air travel.
Brazil shows little change. Chile’s rate falls to less than 8 per cent. In Mexico, “core-core” inflation is slightly more than 3 per cent — less than half the rate in the US.
Narain expects policymakers to keep their focus on headline inflation. But if demand in Mexico is as soft as he thinks, bonds could be in for an early fillip. Ten-year local currency bonds were trading at 90 per cent of face value in mid-October. They have already rebounded to 95 per cent.

Before we get started today, a bit of pretty big breaking news: Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest has bought CWP Renewables, one of the country’s largest wind power companies.
Secondly, London-based Bluebell Capital Partners has called on BlackRock founder Larry Fink to resign as chief executive over the “apparent hypocrisy” of the asset manager’s use of environmental, social and governance investment factors. Bluebell has only a 0.01 per cent stake in BlackRock. Still its campaign is a remarkable attack on the world’s biggest asset manager.
As Kenza flagged earlier this week, COP15 — the biodiversity-focused counterpart to last month’s COP27 climate summit — gets under way today. Expect particularly intense discussion of the fate of the world’s oceans. At last week’s meeting between Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, the duo called for the UN to complete its treaty on protecting the high seas next year. As I noted last month, progress on this agreement hit a wall this summer. Negotiations are being revived in Montreal, and the big political power Biden and Macron threw behind the treaty should give it a boost.
Today, I look at another topic at COP15 that is likely to be a lot more controversial: biodiversity credits. Critics are warning that these credits could allow for pervasive greenwashing.
Also today, Tamami writes about a move in Australia to rein in carbon emissions in the kitchen. Bon appétit. (Patrick Temple-West)
One of the top issues up for debate at COP15 in the days ahead will be “biodiversity offsets,” a cousin of carbon credits that is increasingly in vogue.
The term has already been included in an early COP15 draft agreement, and on Monday the UN Development Programme and the UK’s International Institute for Environment and Development published a report endorsing biodiversity offsets (sometimes known as biocredits).
But the credits are drawing fire over the trade-offs they may require. To build an airport, for example, you might need to destroy wetlands inhabited by flamingos. A developer might seek to use biocredits to “offset” the destruction of the wetlands by nurturing a similar environment nearby.
The newest iteration of biocredits, however, includes a significant flaw, Frédéric Hache — executive director of the Brussels-based Green Finance Observatory — told me. You can plough up the wetlands if you build a habitat, in a totally different location, for a species that is more endangered. This type of offset is described by the EU as “like for like or better”. The scheme providing the offsets would serve “a higher conservation priority” than the ecosystem being adversely affected (sorry, flamingos).
For years, there has been a lobbying push for biocredits, Hache said. Rich-world supporters of the biocredit concept, he suggests, are reasoning that “if you create such a market you establish the status quo” — essentially you can continue to grow, and deal with your environmental problems elsewhere.
“And, as an added bonus, you create a new asset class for the finance sector,” he said.
Wall Street, already increasingly involved in the carbon credit market, is getting interested in this space too. IHS Markit has added biodiversity credits to its registry of various environmental offsets.
We, and other FT colleagues, have been highlighting the flaws in the carbon offset sector, from questionable corporate claims to brokers’ hefty cuts. Biodiversity credits create further opportunities for confusion and greenwashing because of the vast range of projects that can be deemed to support biodiversity (from wetlands to rainforests or coral reefs), Hache said.
In their report, the UNDP and IIED explicitly stressed that biocredits should not be used “to offset damage elsewhere”. Instead, they said, the instruments could flourish as a new financial asset class in its own right, to expand “private and public finance for conservation in ways that benefit marginalised people”. 
But given the intense corporate appetite for offsets of every stripe, and the continued lack of rigorous rules and guidelines, the greenwashing risks in this young sector seem clear. (Patrick Temple-West)
In the automotive market, the shift from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric vehicles is well under way. In the kitchen, however, consumers have proved much slower to give up their gas cookers. But there are signs that could be starting to change.
Lendlease, one of Australia’s largest property developers, has said it will stop providing gas connections for kitchens in its new developments by 2030. The company, which manages $28.9bn in funds and operates in Asia, Europe and the US as well as in Australia, has also committed to replacing all of the gas appliances in its existing buildings by 2040.
Lendlease is part of the Global Cooksafe Coalition, a campaign launched late last month in Sydney to promote the benefits of electric cooking over natural gas. The initiative aims to reduce carbon dioxide and methane emissions — which damaging effects both on the climate crisis, and on human health. Research shows that children living in homes with gas cookers are 42 per cent more likely to develop asthma, the GCC said.
“The stark reality is that gas is responsible for 15 per cent of building energy consumption in Australia”, said Davina Rooney, chief executive at Green Building Council of Australia and board director of the World Green Building Council. “Eliminating gas from our buildings would make a material difference in a short space of time.”
Efforts to decarbonise kitchens have also been springing up in the US. A number of cities including San Francisco and New York have banned gas connections in new buildings. But the GCC is unique in “bringing together chefs, developers, suppliers, health experts and industry bodies”, Ann Austin, head of sustainability at Lendlease Australia, told me — key to taking on years of advertising that has marketed gas stoves as being a better cooking method than their electric counterparts.
Austin explains that, while there are still questions and concerns in the broader industry that are holding back big changes, pressure on Lendlease from its investors and clients had pushed it to expand its action on this front.
After Australia, the GCC plans to launch in the EU and UK in April 2023 and in the US a few months later. The fight to get gas out of the kitchen is heating up. (Tamami Shimizuishi, Nikkei)

The Financial Conduct Authority has decided to fine Diego Urra £395,000, and Jorge Lopez Gonzalez and Poojan Sheth £100,000 each for market abuse and ban them from “performing any functions in relation to regulated activity”, the watchdog said on Wednesday.
The FCA said the traders placed “large misleading orders” for Italian sovereign bond futures that “they did not intend to execute, giving false and misleading signals and a false or misleading impression as to the supply or demand” of the securities from June 1 to July 29 2016.
“At the same time, they placed small orders which they did intend to execute on the opposite side of the order book,” the FCA added.
The traders repeated this pattern of “deliberate and intentional market manipulation on a number of occasions and were dishonest”, the regulator said.
The traders are contesting the FCA’s decision and have referred it to the upper tribunal, an independent body where people can challenge the regulator’s decisions. The tribunal will hear both sides of the case and determine whether to approve the FCA’s decision.
Urra had more than 18 years of experience in financial services and joined Mizuho International in 2013, according to the FCA. He managed the company’s European government bond desk and oversaw both Lopez Gonzalez and Sheth, who had 10 and four years of trading experience respectively.
The FCA said the trio carried out an “abusive trading strategy” for Italian government bond futures by placing a large order to create the impression of increased supply or demand. This would help them execute a smaller genuine order that they actually wanted to trade on the opposite side of the order book.
“The purpose of this was to create the impression that there was additional supply in the market with the aim of encouraging other market participants to sell,” the regulator said, therefore increasing the chance of their own order being executed. Once the smaller genuine trade was complete, they would cancel the large placements.
The FCA found that each individual carried out such trades more than 30 times on their own, as well as acting together on more than 60 occasions.
“This market manipulation was serious and directly undermined the integrity of the market,” the regulator said.
The fines and bans reflect the “serious nature of the breaches” and should act as a deterrent to other market participants, the FCA said.
“Mizuho International is not party to these proceedings in relation to former employees, and the FCA has confirmed there are no other investigations or actions pending in respect of these matters,” Mizuho said, adding that the company “was cleared of any wrongdoing in 2019”.
“Mizuho International itself reported these events to the FCA in 2016 and has fully co-operated with the FCA throughout its investigation,” the company added.

Bluebell Capital Partners went public with its concerns about the world’s largest money manager on Tuesday, releasing a letter it had sent to Fink last month.
Giuseppe Bivona and Marco Taricco, Bluebell’s co-chief investment officers, contended that BlackRock had changed positions several times on investing in thermal coal production while failing to live up to Fink’s widely publicised sustainability commitments. Shareholder data show Bluebell has about a 0.01 per cent stake in BlackRock, which has a market capitalisation of $107bn.
“The contradictions and apparent hypocrisy of BlackRock’s actions have . . . politicised the ESG debate,” they wrote. “The reputational damage of being dragged into this politically charged debate, in our view, is very significant because it calls into question the independency of BlackRock as an asset manager.”
The Bluebell partners added that it had “direct experience . . . [with] BlackRock’s inconsistent approach”. They said BlackRock failed to support Bluebell’s position on environmental shareholder resolutions at mining and commodities group Glencore and chemicals group Solvay.
BlackRock said: “In the past 18 months, Bluebell has waged a number of campaigns to promote their climate and governance agenda. BlackRock Investment Stewardship did not support their campaigns as we did not consider them to be in the best economic interests of our clients.”

BlackRock has been hit with criticisms from both sides of the sustainability debate. Texas officials have put it on a list of fund managers they consider hostile to fossil fuel, and Republican officials in several states have pulled money out of BlackRock funds. Democratic officials complain the company has not gone far enough in its support for reducing carbon emissions.
Bluebell is best known for helping to topple the chief executive at Danone in 2021 despite holding less than €20mn in shares and having total assets of €70mn. It has been sparring with luxury group Richemont over its dual-class share structure since earlier this year. BlackRock voted against Bluebell’s proposals to give ordinary shareholders more say over director elections.
Bivona told the Financial Times that Bluebell bought into BlackRock earlier this year and now has about $250mn under management.
He said he particularly objected to BlackRock’s new Voting Choice programme, which allows institutional investors to vote their own shares on contested proxy issues. Bluebell’s letter called voting choice “a clear sign of BlackRock’s capitulation of its obligation to exercise its fiduciary duties and little more than a cute commercial tool”.

A group of 69 low- and middle-income countries will make payments of $62bn on public debt this year, a 35 per cent increase from 2021, according to the bank’s annual data published on Tuesday.
Payments for 2023 and 2024 will remain elevated, the World Bank warned, due to high interest rates, a large number of bond maturities, and because countries have had to start making up for debt service that was deferred during the pandemic.
A surge in inflation has forced central banks to raise rates sharply this year, increasing global borrowing costs in the process. The dollar has also soared in value off the back of several large rate rises by the US Federal Reserve.
“The increased liquidity pressures in poor countries go hand in hand with solvency challenges, causing a debt overhang that is unsustainable for dozens of countries,” said David Malpass, World Bank president.
“With the 2022 growth outlook cut in half, interest rates much higher, and many currencies depreciating, the burden of debt is likely to increase further.”
Zambia and Sri Lanka are among the countries that have defaulted on sovereign debts since the start of the pandemic. Ghana and Egypt are in advanced stages of talks with the IMF over bailout packages.
This week, Ghana told holders of local currency government bonds to expect reduced coupon payments. Last month, it said the value of its foreign currency bonds could be cut by 30 per cent, although the IMF has yet to complete the debt sustainability analysis that would be the basis of any support package. Its currency, the cedi, has lost more than half of its dollar value this year, making it much harder to service dollar-denominated debts.
Such problems are far from isolated cases. The World Bank said nearly 60 per cent of low-income countries were at high risk of debt distress or already experiencing it.
The total external public and private sector debts of all low- and middle-income countries reached $9.3tn in 2021, up from $8.2tn in 2019 and $8.6tn in 2020, according to the World Bank’s annual debt statistics report published on Tuesday.

Many developing economies have put on a spurt of growth as they emerged from the pandemic. As a result, their debts fell as a share of gross national income to 25.7 per cent in 2021, from a peak of 28.5 per cent of GNI in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. This was below the pre-pandemic level of 26.3 per cent of GNI in 2019, according to the bank’s data.
But the debts of the poorest countries remained high last year both in absolute terms and as a share of national income. For the 69 countries eligible for assistance from the World Bank’s International Development Association, external debts fell only slightly to 36.2 per cent of GNI last year, from 36.8 per cent in 2020. That was higher than the 32.8 per cent recorded in 2019.
In dollar terms, their combined debts were $948bn last year, up from $767bn in 2019 and $859bn in 2020, according to World Bank data.
Global central banks cut interest rates to all-time lows and pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system through their quantitative easing programmes following the global financial crisis. Borrowing costs have remained at ultra-low levels until this year, triggering a large expansion in global debt.
