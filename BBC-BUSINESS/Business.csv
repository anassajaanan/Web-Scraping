""It doesn't seem like they're interested in doing anything,"" he says.
""We haven't had a single penny,"" he says.
""We've sent them so many emails, and after four or five months they reply: 'Please have patience, Mr Sethi'.""
""I mean, how long can I have patience for?"" he says.
""I get quite angry and bitter when I think about it, as I've had to struggle all of my life due to the failings of the Horizon system, and yet still I am treated like this,"" he said.
""Over 70% of applications have accepted an offer and received payment; and 95% of applicants should receive an offer by the end of this year. The scheme has also been extended to anyone who wants to submit a late application,"" he said.
""These people are in their 70s and 80s, they're sick and tired of fighting,"" he says. ""They don't want the spectre of the Post Office haunting them any further.""
